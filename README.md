- Ctrl+L: Focus URL bar
- Up/Down: Scroll Content
- i: Enter interaction mode
- q or Ctrl+C: Quit

- Terminal-Friendly : Compatible with most terminal emulators.
- Open Source: Built with the community in mind for extensibility and collaboration.
- Cross Compatible: Compatible with Windows 7, 8, 10 and 11, MacOS, and Linux (any distro compatible with npm)
